# Basic Information
## Here is some basic information about me.
My name is Quin Taylor and I am a 21 year old junior attending the University of Missouri. I am majoring in Information Technology and hope to pursue a career in cybersecurity past college. I am a triplet with two sisters that also attend Mizzou. 
<br><p>Below is code I created in Python in my IT class that finds the volume of a cylinder:</p>
<p>import math</p>
<p>radius = float(input("Enter the radius of the cylinder. "))</p>
<p>height = float(input("Enter the height of the cylinder. "))</p>
<p>volume = math.pi*radius**2*height</p>
<p>print("The volume of the cylinder is", volume)</p>
